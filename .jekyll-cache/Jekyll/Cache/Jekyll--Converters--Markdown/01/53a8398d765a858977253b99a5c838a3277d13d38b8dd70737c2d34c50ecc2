<p>I’m an American that ended up in Kyiv, Ukraine — plus a few stops along the way.</p>

<p>After eight years of teaching English, I became a UX writer. In other words,  a copywriter that doubles as a technical writer and understands user experience.</p>

<p>I love exploring, whether that be my own consciousness via <a href="/blog/tags#meditation">meditation</a>, constantly <a href="/blog/tags#books">reading</a> or long bike rides.</p>
