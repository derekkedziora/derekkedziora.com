I"ã<p>A recent visit to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff got me thinking about life around the solar system, and there are surprisingly many places that <a href="https://www.space.com/15716-alien-life-search-solar-system.html" title="space.com">could support life</a>. If we eventually find life in a multiple places, that makes it far more probable that biological life is widespread across the universe. This <em>should</em> banish our remaining thoughts of anthropocentrism.</p>
