I"–<p>My list is definitely not exhaustive, but here‚Äôs a few of the more common ‚Äòslavicisms‚Äô I hear.</p>

<h2 id="bring--take">bring / take</h2>

<p>Bring always shows motion towards the speaker, while take shows motion going away from the speaker.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My wife told me to <strong>take</strong> an umbrella with me when I left for work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I‚Äôm at the office:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since it rained, I was glad that I had <strong>brought</strong> my umbrella to the office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I‚Äôm not longer at work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs a good thing I <strong>took</strong> my umbrella to work today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that ‚Äúwith you‚Äù can be dropped when it‚Äôs clear from context.</p>

<h2 id="go--come--get">go / come / get</h2>

<p>Similarly, <em>come</em> shows movement relative to the speaker‚Äôs position. <em>Get</em> shows completed motion. Also, it‚Äôs more common to use location than motion.</p>

<p>Location:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôm already at work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Motion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôve already arrived at / got to/ / made it to work).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Come</strong>: motion towards the speaker<br />
<strong>Go</strong>: general motion<br />
<strong>Get</strong>: completed motion</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still at work in this case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I <strong>came</strong> to work at 9 AM this morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I‚Äôm not referencing my current location:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I <strong>go</strong> to work everyday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The emphasis is on the completed action, not my current location:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I <strong>got</strong> to work at 9 AM this morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An easy trick is to put <em>here</em> in a sentence with <em>come</em>. If it doesn‚Äôt fit, use <strong>get</strong> or <strong>go</strong> instead.</p>

<h2 id="by--until">by / until</h2>

<p><em>Until</em> shows how long an action is going to take place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>–Ø –±—É–¥—É –≤ –ö–∏–µ–≤–µ –¥–æ –ø—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—ã.  <br />
I‚Äôll be in Kyiv <strong>until</strong> Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use <em>by</em> for deadlines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>–ú–Ω–µ –Ω–∞–¥–æ –¥–æ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç –¥–æ –ø—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—ã.<br />
I have to finish the project <strong>by</strong> Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="feel-myself">feel (myself)</h2>

<p>It sounds awkward to say <em>feel myself</em> with an adjective. Drop <em>myself</em> from these sentences:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel tired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use <em>feel myself</em> with a gerund.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was so tired that I could <strong>feel myself</strong> falling asleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="make--do-a-mistake">make / do a mistake</h2>

<p>We <em>make mistakes</em>. We never do mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="latinate-vocabulary">Latinate vocabulary</h2>

<p>Watch for register. These are all day-to-day words in Russian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>–û–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å —Å–æ–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ –∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã—Ö</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don‚Äôt translate them with super formal, Latin words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code>Communication with an interlocutor regarding acquaintances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go for day-to-day words instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Talking to somebody about people we know.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="i--we-and--with">I / we, and / with</h2>

<p>The same person can‚Äôt appear in both subject and the object of a sentence.</p>

<p>There are are a minimum of three people in this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We discussed with you‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We join people in the subject with <em>and</em> not <em>with</em>. <em>I</em> always comes last in standard English.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My friend and I‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>never:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I with my friend‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="borrow--lend">borrow / lend</h2>

<p>The correct way to use these:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I <strong>borrowed</strong> money from the bank.  <br />
The bank <strong>lent</strong> (loaned) me money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="explain-to-me">Explain to me</h2>

<p><em>Explain</em> requires a direct object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CEO <strong>explained</strong> the new product (direct object) to us (indirect object).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can‚Äôt drop the direct object, and we have to add <em>to</em> before the indirect object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My psychologist is the only one who can <strong>explain me</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="word-order-in-embedded-answers">Word order in embedded answers</h2>

<p>This is correct:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don‚Äôt know why people make this mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code>I don‚Äôt know why do people make this mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn‚Äôt a question; drop the do.</p>

<p>Also watch out for the word order change:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don‚Äôt know what time it is.</p>
</blockquote>
