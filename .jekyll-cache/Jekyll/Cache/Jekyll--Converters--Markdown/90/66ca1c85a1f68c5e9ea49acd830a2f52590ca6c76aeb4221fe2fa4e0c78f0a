I"û<p>Should is one of the most misused words by non-native speakers and can instantly make your language sound rude, condescending or just plain unnatural.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-not-use-should">Where to Not Use Should</h2>

<p><strong>Giving directions</strong></p>

<p>Letâ€™s say a recruiter needs to tell a candidate how to find the office:</p>

<p>[0.a] <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code><em>You should take the metro to our office.</em></p>

<p>[1.a] <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code><em>You should get off at Kontraktova Ploshcha.</em></p>

<p>Instead, give raw information and reasons:</p>

<p>[0.b] <em>We donâ€™t have a lot of parking near the office, so it is easier to take the metro.</em></p>

<p>[1.b] <em>Kontraktova Ploshcha is the closest metro station</em></p>

<p><strong>Procedures</strong></p>

<p>[2.a] <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code><em>I should pass the exam to get a driverâ€™s license</em></p>

<p>In this case there is no choice. If I donâ€™t pass the exam, thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll get a license. <em>Supposed to</em>, <em>ought to</em> and <em>should</em> all carry a sense of choice, whereas <em>must</em>, <em>have to</em> and <em>need to</em> show that there is no choice.</p>

<p>[2.b] <em>I need to pass the exam to get a driverâ€™s license.</em></p>

<p><strong>Requests</strong>*</p>

<p>If something is a request, donâ€™t use should.</p>

<p>[3.a] <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code><em>You should call me back by the end of the week.</em></p>

<p>This sounds like a command. A more neutral sounding request would be:</p>

<p>[3.b] <em>Could you call me back by the end of the week?</em></p>

<p>You can add a reason to make the request more urgent:</p>

<p>[3.c] <em>Please let me know by the end of the week so I can process your order on time.</em></p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-should">How to Use Should</h2>

<p><strong>Predictions</strong></p>

<p>The most common place to properly use should is with predictions. This is part of the larger system of  <a href="/english/modal-verbs-probability-inference">evidentiality in English</a>.</p>

<p>[4.a] <em>It should snow tomorrow.</em></p>

<p>[4.b] <em>Itâ€™s a bit too warm; it shouldnâ€™t snow tomorrow.</em></p>

<p>[5.a] <em>I should be on time, since traffic isnâ€™t bad.</em></p>

<p>Sentence [5.a] usually wouldnâ€™t be negated. Instead:</p>

<p>[5.b] <em>Traffic is bad today; Iâ€™m (going to / will) be late.</em></p>

<p><strong>Impersonal Obligations</strong></p>

<p>While Iâ€™d avoid using <em>should</em> for a personal obligation, it is useful to talk about more general social obligations. The first person singular is often used:</p>

<p>[6.a] <em>We should consider alternatives to our current strategy.</em></p>

<p>Itâ€™s still possible to not use <em>should</em> in this context:</p>

<p>[6.b] <em>Letâ€™s look at some alternatives to our current strategy.</em></p>

<p>When you is used, make sure it is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_you">impersonal you</a>. This can be tricky in English as context is the only way to distinguish these, whereas in other languages, such as German, the difference is marked:</p>

<p>[7.a.de] <em>Du sollst deine Hausaufgaben machen.</em></p>

<p>[7.b.de] <em>Man soll seine Hausaufgaben machen.</em></p>

<p>We can translate this impersonally as:</p>

<p>[7.b.en] <em>You should do your homework.</em></p>

<p><strong>Personal Advice</strong></p>

<p>This is a danger zone and using should here often comes off rather rude. While we could use <em>should</em>, it would best be reserved for a parent or teacher scolding a child.</p>

<p>[7.a.en.1] <em>Please do your homework.</em></p>

<p>Itâ€™s even better to use a conditional for personal advice:</p>

<p>[7.a.en.2] <em>Youâ€™ll remember the material better if you do the homework.</em></p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>Yes or no questions can be asked using should.</p>

<p>[8.a] <em>Should I open the window?</em></p>

<p>Another structure that works just as well:</p>

<p>[8.b] <em>Would you like me to open the window?</em></p>

<p><strong>Regrets</strong></p>

<p>[9] <em>I should have eaten breakfast this morning.</em></p>

<p>[10] <em>My friend shouldnâ€™t have traveled to Asia, because he got very sick.</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><em>Should</em> can be tricky to use without sounding a bit rude. In most cases, you are better off avoiding it altogether. The imperative plus please is perfectly polite. <em>Could you</em> also works for requests.</p>

<p>If you do use should, stick to the first person or third person. Itâ€™s best to use the general you instead of a personal you with should.</p>

<p>The best advice is to observe how native speakers use modal verbs. Pick a podcast or blog post that uses the word and analyze how it is used. Adopt the same usage yourself.</p>
