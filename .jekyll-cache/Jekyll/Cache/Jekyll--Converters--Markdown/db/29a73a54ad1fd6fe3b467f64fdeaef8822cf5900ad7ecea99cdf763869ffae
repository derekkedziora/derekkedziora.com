I"<p>At some point, every language learner has wished that their target language were more logical. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>, an entirely logical language, already exists, and it’s entire grammar is based solely on logic. A look through <a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/How_to_say_it_in_Lojban">the Lobjan guide</a> would likely enthrall a logician—figuring out simple words requires a truth table. Not surprisingly, the practical applications of Lojban are limited.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget that languages have to be processed by the human brain, with it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#Dual-process_accounts_of_reasoning">system 1 and 2</a>. Nearly all spoken language uses system 1, yet most language learning centers on system 2. Were we to use system 2 as our primary linguistic processing mechanism, the pace of communication would grind to a halt while the computational cost of this communication would preclude nearly any simultaneous activity. Even making a passing mental note about the weather would require a shift into system 2 if one were thinking in an entirely logical language. Using system 2 can help you write an email or craft a blog post, but it’s inefficient for most of our daily linguistic needs.</p>

<p>The difficulty for second language learning arises when teachers focus entirely on system 2. The traditional approach that I’ve observed of grammar instruction followed by exercises from a textbook is great at training students to use system 2 in an entirely artificial context. It rarely results in students developing the heuristics, biases and instincts needed to use a foreign language within a system 1 context.</p>

<p>Learning English requires adopting the system 1 of an English-speaker. The role of the teacher is to create contexts that lead students into system 1 thinking and provide feedback. A simple sentence contains an incredible amount of information, but each language encodes this information differently. English-speakers explicitly mark identification or classification (the vs. a/an) while other languages rely on context or different phrasing. Conversely, English-speakers have no need to mark the gender of the agent of a past action as Slavic languages do; context suffices for us. A good teacher can help students figure out and develop this encoding for themselves.</p>

<p>Approaching language learning this way prepares students to actually use their target language functionally. Applying system 2 logic to what is primarily a system 1 function will cause consternation and unnatural language production. Look at the quirks of any natural language and realize that that language serves as a medium of communication because of, rather than in spite of, its illogical features.</p>
