I"l<p>Most English adjectives that describe an emotional experience end in either -ing or -ed.</p>

<p>For instance, take the word interest:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The book <em>interests</em> me. (verb)</li>
  <li>I’m <em>interested</em> in the book. (the experiencer, -ed)</li>
  <li>The book is <em>interesting</em>. (the source of the experience, -ing)</li>
</ol>

<p>The experiencer takes an -ed adjective, while the source of the experience goes with an -ing adjective. Generally, inanimate objects can only take -ing.</p>

<p>Animate objects can take either -ing or -ed. Hence, a teacher could be boring if the students are about to fall asleep, or a teacher could be bored if they’ve already taught the same lesson a hundred times.</p>

<p>Looking at our example again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The book [source] interests [emotion] me [experiencer]</li>
  <li>[source] [to be] [emotion]+ing</li>
  <li>[experiencer] [to be] [emotion]+ed</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re not sure which form to use, rephrase your sentence with a verb instead of an adjective. The word order will always tell you whether the adjective should take -ed or -ing.</p>
