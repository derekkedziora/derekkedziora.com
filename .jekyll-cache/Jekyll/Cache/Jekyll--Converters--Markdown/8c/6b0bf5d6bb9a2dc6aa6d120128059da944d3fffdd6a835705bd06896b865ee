I"=<p>English has a complex system of marking whether something was observed [<em>It rained</em> means that I saw it rain] or whether someone came to conclusion [<em>It must have rained</em> means that Iâ€™m nearly certain that it rained, because it is cloudy and the sidewalk is wet]. The degree of certainty can be modified by switching out must for may or could.</p>

<p>It is more natural to show this information through modal verbs than adverbs of probability such as certainly, probably or definitely. This can be seen by looking at the <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=probably+rained%2Cmust+have+rained%2Ccertainly+rained&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cprobably%20rained%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmust%20have%20rained%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccertainly%20rained%3B%2Cc0">ngrams</a> comparing probably rained, certainly rained and must have rained.</p>

<p>This is also why opinions arenâ€™t explicitly marked by phrases such as <em>in my opinion</em>, <em>to my mind</em> or <em>I think</em> that often in English. A modal verb automatically tells the listener you are stating an opinion and your level of certainty. While the sentence <em>In my opinion, it definitely rained</em> isnâ€™t a mistake, it sounds far more natural to say <em>It must have rained</em>.</p>

<p>The following story illustrates the context that various modals can be used in:</p>

<p>1) Letâ€™s say you went to bed one evening in January and noticed that there was no snow on the ground.</p>

<p><em>Fantastic! There <strong>shouldnâ€™t</strong> be any problems with traffic on the way to work tomorrow.</em></p>

<p>2) Unfortunately for you, when you woke the next morning you saw a thick covering of snow.</p>

<p><em>Uh-oh, it <strong>must have</strong> snowed last night</em></p>

<p>3) You decided to take the subway to work rather than driving.</p>

<p><em>The subway <strong>has to</strong> be running since it is underground. It <strong>must</strong> be unaffected by the bad weather.</em></p>

<p>4) When you got to the station and were about to pay for your fare, you realized that you didnâ€™t have your wallet.</p>

<p><em>I <strong>might have</strong> left it at home or my wife <strong>may have</strong> accidentally put it in her purse.</em></p>

<p>5) Itâ€™s nearly impossible, but:</p>

<p><em>It <strong>could have</strong> been stolen.</em></p>

<p>6) Rather than worry about your wallet, you decided to sneak onto the subway without a ticket. When you finally got to the office, your friends are shocked and said:</p>

<p><em>You <strong>might have</strong> been caught. You <strong>could have</strong> been arrested.</em></p>

<p>7) One of your co-workers knows you better than the rest and realizes that you love jokes and exaggerating a bit.</p>

<p><em>You <strong>canâ€™t</strong> be serious. You <strong>mustnâ€™t</strong> be telling the truth since you have a reputation for telling tall tales!</em></p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>1) <strong>should + [do], shouldnâ€™t + [do]</strong><br />
<em>Should</em> or <em>shouldnâ€™t</em> is used for a highly probable future event. The sentence <em>He should be on time for the meeting.</em> means that there is a high probability that he will be on time for the meeting rather than he ought to be on time for the meeting.</p>

<p>2) <strong>must have + [done], must not have + [done]</strong><br />
<em>Must have</em> shows that you have made a conclusion about a past event and are nearly certain. This can <strong>never</strong> mean a past obligation. For that we use <em>had to</em>. For example: <em>Tony had to study for the exam because he wanted to get a good grade</em> (obligation) vs. <em>Tony must have studied for the exam because he got a good grade</em> (inference based on evidence).</p>

<p>3) <strong>[have / has] to + [do], must + [do]</strong><br />
These equivalent structures show a conclusion about a present situation and need to be distinguished from obligation. <em>Lisa must be at the office since sheâ€™s not home</em> (inference) vs. <em>Lisa must be at the office, because her boss wonâ€™t let her go home early.</em> (obligation). In the present these have the same form but use different past forms: <em>Lisa must have been at the office this morning since she wasnâ€™t at home</em> vs. <em>Lisa had to stay at the office late, because her boss wouldnâ€™t let her go home early</em>.</p>

<p>4) <strong>might have [done], may have [done]</strong><br />
These structures have the same meaning: a conclusion has been reached about a past even with less certainty than <em>must have</em>.</p>

<p>5) <strong>could have [done]</strong><br />
This shows an even lower probability for a past even than <em>might have</em>.</p>

<p>6) <strong>could have [done], might have [done]</strong><br />
<em>Might have</em> and <em>could have</em> carry a different meaning than those in points four and five. In this meaning a possible past event that didnâ€™t occur is described. It is important to distinguish this from point four since <em>may have</em> cannot be used here. For example, a mother has found out that her son was playing with matches and yells that <em>he could have burned down the whole house and might have even killed himself</em>.</p>

<p>7) <strong>canâ€™t [do], mustnâ€™t [do]</strong><br />
These structures show that a present situation is impossible. Note the difference between canâ€™t / mustnâ€™t showing an inference and the same words showing ability or prohibition. <em>He canâ€™t [must not] be in a good after he missed lunch.</em> (inference) vs. <em>He canâ€™t [must not] run in the marathon due to his doctorâ€™s orders</em> (ability [prohibition]). The first example takes this form in the past: <em>He couldnâ€™t [must not] have been in a good mood after he had missed lunch.</em> while the second would be <em>He couldnâ€™t [wasnâ€™t allowed to] run in the marathon due to his doctorâ€™s orders.</em></p>
