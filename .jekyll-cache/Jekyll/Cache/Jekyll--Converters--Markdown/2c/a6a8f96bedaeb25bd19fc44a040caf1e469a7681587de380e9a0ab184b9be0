I"<p>When I opt in, I specifically tell a company that I want to use their services.  This should be the default. Instead, the corporate juggernauts are happily using personal information without consentâ€‰â€”â€‰they get the profits, youâ€™re left with the downside.</p>

<p>Take Equifax. I had no need for them to gather my personal data, nor did I even know they were doing so. A company that I never asked, much less gave my consent to, collected my data and then exposed it. I have to bear the risk of identity theft for the rest of my life; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-07/equifax-breach-a-year-later-record-profits-share-price-revival">Equifax posted record profits after their data breach</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook and Google are also gathering massive amounts of data about you, even if you donâ€™t use their services. Both companies have cookies and analytics spanning much of the internet. Without your knowledge or consent, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy">Facebook has created a profile for you</a>.</p>

<p>My beef with Facebook goes deeper. A former co-worker sent me this profile:</p>

<p><img src="/static/posts/2018-11-01/im-not-sergei.png" alt="Fake FB profile using my picture" /></p>

<p>Thatâ€™s clearly my picture, but Iâ€™m not Sergei Sribnyy. In fact, I have no idea who he is.</p>

<p>The reason my former coworker stumbled across this was that Sergei Sribnyy was posting inflammatory comments in a Kyiv Facebook group. Thus my picture is associated with some internet loudmouth whoâ€™s insulting people I could run into any day.</p>

<p>This should be easy to solve, right? I dutifully reported the personâ€™s profile. This is the response I got:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this case, we reviewed the profile you reported and found that it doesnâ€™t go against our Community Standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No amount of trying to contact Facebook has helped. Iâ€™ve tried to report the picture as copyrightedâ€‰â€”â€‰after all it belongs to my company and was taken by a photographer we hired. Didnâ€™t work. I also canâ€™t claim this guy is impersonating me since he isnâ€™t using my name.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m stuck. I canâ€™t opt out of something to which I never opted in.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s not blame Sergei here. Sure, heâ€™s probably not a great guy, but thatâ€™s beside the point. Facebook, a company worth billions of dollars, is using my photo without permission for their commercial platform.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t begrudge the Zuckerbergs of the world their billions. My complaint is this yet another case of socializing risk and loss while privatizing profit. As someone who doesnâ€™t use Facebook, I get nothing from the platform, yet I canâ€™t opt out of them tracking me or using my picture. Facebook and their ilk are profitable simply because they skirt responsibility and donâ€™t hire humans to resolve problems their platforms create.</p>

<p>If a traditional advertising agency did the same thing, itâ€™d likely be grounds for a lawsuit. At the very least, Iâ€™d probably be able to contact <em>somebody</em> that works there and get the picture removed.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s also an odd puritanical streak in American business culture. Were I to post a non-sexual nude image of myself, itâ€™d be taken down in a heartbeat. Dodging millions in taxes, hiring contractors as employees, and spreading hate speech barely merit a furrowed brow. A single strand of pubic hair gets instant action from Facebook and public outcry.</p>

<p>Every business should be opt in. Unless I explicitly give them my consent to gather and use my data, companies donâ€™t have the right to profit off of me. Even though I <a href="/blog/delete-facebook">deleted facebook</a> years ago, I still canâ€™t seem to opt out of Facebook.</p>
