I"Ú<p>Homo sapiens <em>were</em> badasses once upon a timeâ€”migrating to and inhabiting nearly every inhospitable crevice of our planet without any succor from modern technology. Led on by the march of decadence, weâ€™ve become fat, lazy, weak and sick; weâ€™re a mere shadow of our species just a century ago.</p>

<h2 id="cold-exposure">Cold Exposure</h2>

<p>Enter Wim Hof, who has hit on something primordial by spending hours in the snow, climbing wintry mountains and running Arctic marathons in a pair of shorts. If all of us couldnâ€™t do similar feats, humans wouldnâ€™t have gotten very far as a species. That is precisely Hofâ€™s point.</p>

<p>Losing touch with this ability is part of the bigger picture of declining physical and mental health in developed countries. Without enough cold or heat stress, the immune system goes haywire. Physical activity and cold exposure leave you feeling euphoric. The most intriguing is that there is some preliminary scientific evidence that Hofâ€™s methods can train people to consciously rev their immune systems up or down.</p>

<h2 id="the-method">The Method</h2>

<p>It takes less than ten minutes to learn the breathing the method; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpTG02x6w5o">this video</a> will get you started. Once you get the breathing down, your cold and heat tolerance will dramatically increase. The breathing ties into meditationâ€”you have to do <em>something</em> while youâ€™re not breathing for two minutes. This mental clarity eases stress, anxiety and depression. Results arenâ€™t instant, but youâ€™ll notice a quick boost right away and a more serious shift within weeks.</p>

<p>Wim Hof is a practitioner but open to being investigated by serious scientists. Hereâ€™s some where to get started learning more about the method:</p>

<p>I love practicing the method. If you do any sort of mindfulness or meditation, the breathing method and breath retentions are very centering. The cold showers are an acquired tasted, but now that Iâ€™m used to them I actually enjoy them.</p>

<p>Practicing the method has made me want to be closer to the current temperature outside than a â€˜comfortableâ€™ room temperature. Iâ€™m just fine without a jacket in moderate cold and a light jacket throughout the winter.</p>

<p>A cold shower is a huge mood booster. I somehow feel warm and happy stepping out of my frigid shower.</p>

<p>Embracing the cold is only the beginning of a few life hacks that can bring big results from relatively little effort: <a href="/blog/3-day-fast">fasting</a>, going towards a paleo-ish diet and <a href="/blog/darkness">cutting down on artificial light in the evening</a>.</p>
