<h2 id="smartphone-cases-obscure-beauty">Smartphone cases obscure beauty</h2>

<p>I fell in love with my phone again by ditching the case. My phoneâ€™s about three years old anyway, so I figured itâ€™s not the end of the world if it gets scratched or whatever. Holy smokes. The feel of just how thin and light a phone is without a case is awesome. Not seeing the screen through a cheap plastic protector brought the display to life. Even when I eventually get a new phone, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m getting another case.</p>

<h2 id="deutsche-welle-makes-great-documentaries">Deutsche Welle makes great documentaries</h2>

<p>While Vice News had a good run, their questionable journalism ethics and slumping quality has put me off of them. Deutsche Welle is my new go-to channel to watch when Iâ€™m looking for an interesting documentary. If you have some time to kill:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m49vNjEGs">Money in the World Economy</a> explains how central banks creating â€˜cheapâ€™ cash has driven up asset prices and exacerbated global inequality.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KPWLSVn0ko">Too Much Milk in Europe</a> covers the absurdity of EU agricultural subsidies that make German milk cheaper in Africa than local milk.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_ODFlqURxY">From Rio to Limaâ€‰â€”â€‰TransoceÃ¢nica</a> is an awesome travelogue covering a bus journey from Brazil to Peru.</li>

<h2 id="music-subscriptions-dont-pay">Music subscriptions donâ€™t pay</h2>

<p>I suppose Iâ€™m not a power listener, but the allure of â€˜unlimitedâ€™ streaming is deceptive. Around 90% of my music comes from 10 albums, which I could outright buy instead of subscribing to streaming service for a year. YouTube is good enough for sampling and that other 10% I listen to. My guess is that Iâ€™d be more satisfied buying 5 albums a year, and the artists I like would get more money anyway.</p>

<h2 id="paper-books-are-awesome">Paper books are awesome</h2>

<p>I do a ton of reading and have been primarily using the Kindle app on my iPad to read for the past two years. This past weekend I started reading a paper book, and my oh, oh my was it lovely. No eye strain, no headache. My biggest problem is that my reading preferences are very specific, so itâ€™s not easy to sell or give away books once I read them. I havenâ€™t decided for sure, but I think Iâ€™m going to ditch the iPad and get an e-ink reader for books that I canâ€™t get paper copies of or wouldnâ€™t be able to resell.</p>

<h2 id="a-tablet-is-an-odd-device">A tablet is an odd device</h2>

<p>For awhile I really liked my iPad, but weâ€™re going through a rough patch. Iâ€™m a power user of my laptop and find that writing, working and putzing around with blogging, code and all that is a pain from an iPad. As a content consumption device, tablets are great, but after staring at a screen all day, I find that more temptation to look at a screen is the last thing I need. Tablets are best suited for people who donâ€™t need a laptop as their home computing device, which is probably the majority of the population. For better or worse, thatâ€™s not me.</p>

<h2 id="i-detest-electron-apps">I detest electron apps</h2>

<p>For the love of all things holy, why canâ€™t companies that are valued at over a billion dollars make native apps? Slack kills my phone battery and takes forever to load even on a new-ish laptop. Sublime is a pleasure to use compared to VS Code and Atom. Iâ€™m not blasting solo-developers that open source a pet project here; my wrath is directed at Slack, Microsoft, GitHub, Google and HubSpot (which forces me to use Chrome for email)â€‰â€”â€‰they all have the resources to develop native apps. FWIW, Sublime has <em>two</em> developers.</p>

<h2 id="intrusive-marketing">Intrusive marketing</h2>

<p>The Economist went from being one of the best magazines to a spammy rag. I donâ€™t need a million scripts loading to read a 1000-word article, especially if Iâ€™m a paying subscriber. So while Iâ€™m sure some marketing PMs were insisting on more data for God knows what, they lost my money. I can get the Atlantic and NY Times without all the extra crap. Iâ€™m ok with paying for high-quality content as long as I can get it without the ads and bloatware. I wonder how many other companies are losing customers because their product is filled with bloatware.</p>

<h2 id="everybodys-a-design-expert">Everybodyâ€™s a design expert</h2>

<p>I realized that being a designer must suck, because everybody and their brother thinks theyâ€™re a design expert. Itâ€™s just <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a>. People give their opinion on design because itâ€™s easy to sound like you know what youâ€™re talking about and many design principles are best practices based on experience rather than strictly scientific testing. Itâ€™s absurd though to see a designer with 6 years of schooling and a decade in the field being overruled because of someone elseâ€™s whim. How do I know this? Iâ€™m an English teacher and a copywriter: weâ€™re in the same boat.</p>

<p>BTW, I just worked my way through <a href="http://www.powells.com/book/-9781566091596">The Non-Designerâ€™s Design Book</a> and canâ€™t recommend it enough. I also realized that most designers, like copywriters and teachers, intentionally produce garbage since that is what their mangers are most likely to sign off on.</p>
