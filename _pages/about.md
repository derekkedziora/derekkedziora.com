I'm an American that ended up in Kyiv, Ukraine â€” plus a few stops along the way. 

After eight years of teaching English, I became a UX writer. In other words,  a copywriter that doubles as a technical writer and understands user experience.

I love exploring, whether that be my own consciousness via [meditation](/blog/tags#meditation), constantly [reading](/blog/tags#books) or long bike rides.
