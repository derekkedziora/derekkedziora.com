Hey there, I'm Derek. 

I'm a content designer and UX writer. Before that I taught English as a foreign language in Ukraine, China and Saudi Arabia. 

Check out my [CV and portfolio](/portfolio "Portfolio"). 

## A bit about me 

My blog meanders my interests over the years from linguistics, philosophy and teaching to tech, design and UX. 

I'm an American that's spent nearly 10 years living in Ukraine. I'm equally likely to spend the weekend cycling over 100km or reading a good book without leaving the house. I have more books than I'll ever read but still can't leave a bookstore empty handed. 

Outside of putzing around in the tech world — of which I'm firmly in the tech skeptic camp — my biggest interest is Buddhist philosophy. 

## Social without Social Media 

Running a small scale blog brings back a small part of [the web we lost](https://anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/). One of my favorite things about this whole thing is when people stumble across my blog and then reach out to me. I've had some great conversations about programming, travel, life in Ukraine and meditation.  

Email is the best way to contact me: derekkedziora@icloud.com 


## About this site 

This site has been a journey in learning the basics of programming and design over the years. I started with a blank Jekyll theme and have since hand coded the entire site.
