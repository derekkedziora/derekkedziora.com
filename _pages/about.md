I'm a writer in tech. Everything from content strategy, UX writing, copywriting and documentation&thinsp;â€”&thinsp;I've done it. In a past life I was English teacher.

I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona but have spent most of my adult life in Kyiv, Ukraine (long story). Along the way I've lived in Kyrgyzstan, China and Saudi Arabia (even longer story). 

I like reading books about digital minimalism on my iPad and scouring Twitter for productivity hacks when I have things to do.

## Colophon 

This is a [small b blog](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/). It's meant to be lighthearted, rough around the edges and a constant work in progress. 

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build a static site that's served over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

View the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/derekkedziora/derekkedziora.com) and [local change log](/change-log).

My goals are speed, simplicity and longevity. Thus, my site is static HTML, CSS and a few JavaScript enhancements. [It's designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/).

Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com) has heavily influence how I designed my site.
