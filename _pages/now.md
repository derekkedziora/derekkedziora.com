I’ve switched to using an iPad as my main computing device. The overwhelming majority of what I do is either reading or writing, so I don’t feel the whole “is this a laptop replacement” thing. For someone working in UX, this is a fun experiment, since my whole mental model of how computers work has been turned upside down&thinsp;—&thinsp;mostly in a good way.

I’m working through a few books about typography. Once I finish up, I plan to do a redesign of my site and wrote a blogpost or two about my takeaways.
