I’m a partial Apple fanboy.  

## Tech Hardware 

My main personal computing device is an iPad Air 3. When I’m in work mode, it’s on a desk with a magic keyboard, trackpad and Apple Pencil. I decidedly don’t like that keyboard folio&thinsp;—&thinsp;when I’m on the go in tablet mode the on-screen keyboard is good enough. For me the Air is *better* than the pro because of the headphone jack and the price difference is for features that I largely don’t need.  

Now that the 2020 MacBook Air is out (and fixes many of the MacBook issues), I’m not sure I’d go back to laptop as my personal device. The iPad air with all the accessories is still a hair cheaper, but it doubles as a reader, super portable laptop and work computer. I’m still on the fence about what I *need* a MacBook. For now, I’m getting by without one. 

iPhone XR. I was hesitant to buy a big phone, now I can’t image going back to a smaller one. I love that I get more than a day out of the battery, even with heavy use. 

Series 3 Apple Watch. I like this guy, especially the health tracking apps. I can’t say that I’m convinced this is more than a toy, though.
