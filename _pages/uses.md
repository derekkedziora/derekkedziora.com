## Tech Hardware

I'm an Apple guy but not a fanboy. The ecosystem is great for getting my word done and creating something of a private social netword with chat and photo sharing. 

### iPad

My main personal computing device is an iPad Air 3. When I’m in work mode, it’s on a desk with a magic keyboard, trackpad and Apple Pencil. I don’t like the smart keyboard&thinsp;—&thinsp;when I’m on the go in tablet mode the on-screen keyboard is good enough. For me the Air is *better* than the pro because of the headphone jack and the price difference is for features that I largely don’t need.  

### Mac

Now that the 2020 MacBook Air is out (and fixes many of the MacBook issues), I’m not sure I’d go back to laptop as a personal device. The iPad air with all the accessories is still a hair cheaper, but it doubles as a reader, super portable laptop and work computer. I’m still on the fence about what I *need* a MacBook. For now, I’m getting by without one for personal use. 

I have a company-provided MacBook Pro that I use for Sketch, Abstract and a few other Mac only programs.   

The only other niche for a laptop that a tablet just doesn’t hit is doing *a lot* of writing from a couch. Even an iPad with a smart keyboard just isn’t as good. 

### Phone

I love my iPhone XR. I was hesitant to buy a big phone, now I can’t image going back to a smaller one. I get more than a day out of the battery, even with heavy use.

I’m not much of a photographer, so no idea how the camera really stacks up. It’s good enough for me though. 

### Watch

I have a series 3 Apple Watch. I like it, especially the health tracking apps. I can’t say that I’m convinced this is more than a toy, though.

### Overall

This is pretty close to hitting the sweet spot. The only change I’d consider: making the new MacBook Air my main device and switching to an iPad mini as my portable device. Or, if I’m going all in on the iPad perhaps getting the monster iPad Pro plus a mini.
