My first major UX writing project was cleaning up PDFfiller's main user interface. I was part of the team that took the product from the look and feel of an early 2000s website to a more modern user experience. 

The original version was entirely in the style of "Open Document(s)", which I rewrote as "Open".

[![PDFfiller Mybox](/static/PDFfiller/mybox.png "PDFfiller Mybox")](/static/PDFfiller/mybox.png "PDFfiller Mybox")

I also wrote the text for individual features: 

[![PDFfiller LinkToFill](/static/PDFfiller/linktofill.png "PDFfiller LinkToFill")](/static/PDFfiller/linktofill.png "PDFfiller Link2Fill")

I'd rate my text as a partial success. It was a dramatic improvement over the previous version but still fell short in key areas. Management was of the opinion that UX text should be a filler to make the product look betterâ€”the more words, the better! This led to compromises such "Just so you know, envelope names can't be longer than 100 characters." 

On the plus side, these are the key lessons I took away from this project: 
- Content and design need to work together from day one to solve UX issues.
