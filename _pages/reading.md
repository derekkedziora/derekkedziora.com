It’s a constant struggle to stay informed and discover new idea without drinking from the firehose of news and social media. I try to stick to mostly blogs and longer form content. 

First off, get an RSS reader. [News Explorer](https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html) is the best and might be the only one to use iCloud sync.

A read later app is also clutch. [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com) is the only one I know of that offers local, iCloud sync. [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) and [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) are good cloud-based options.  

## News 

The Morning Briefing from the New York Times (European edition in my case) is the best way to get a general idea of what’s going on in under five minutes. They have plenty of other free [email newsletters](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters).

I get weekly emails from [the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com), [the Economist](https://www.economist.com) and [Nautilus](https://nautil.us). I read one or two articles from each a week. 

For a fairly modest investment of time, I find that I’m more informed that most people who constantly check the headlines without being overwhelmed in news. 

For Ukrainian news, [Hromadske](https://hromadske.ua) is my go-to source. 

## Blogosphere 

[No Mercy / No Malice](https://www.profgalloway.com) by Scott Galloway is a good weekly read about tech and business. Direct link to [the RSS feed](https://api.profgalloway.com/feed/), which is hidden. 

[Signal v. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com) by Basecamep. Yes, there’s a lot of self-promotion, but there’s also a lot of good stuff about office culture and tech. 

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org) is bit of the fun randomness the internet once was. 

[Brad Frost’s blog](https://bradfrost.com) hits all the things I like about web design: accessibility, semantic HTML, having fun with CSS and not going overboard with JS. I like the dual designer-developer perspective. 

[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) has tech news, politics and random tidbits. 

[Pedestrian Observations](https://pedestrianobservations.com) is devoted to public transportation geekery. Insanely in-depth stuff about transportation and urban design.   

## Podcasts 

Tim Ferris is … but his guests are amazing. Listen to the [Tim Ferris Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) for them. 

Joe Rogan’s topics are expansive. I listen to maybe 1 out of 10 episodes of [the JRE](http://podcasts.joerogan.net), there’s something for everyone here. Joe is the rare sort that can let people who disagrees with come on the show, be respectful and give them the space to explain himself. 


## Social Media 

Twitter for following tech gossip and big events (my main source for the Ukrainian Revolution and COVID-19). 

Instagram exclusively for IRL friends. No influencers or celebrities.
