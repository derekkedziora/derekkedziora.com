## UX  Writing
I created all of the text and crafted the flow for Wix's [WordPress Blog Importer](https://wix.com/blog-importer) from scratch. Additionally, I was responsible for coördinating the localization of the importer into 20 languages. 

## Blogging 

My reflections on how dealing with data as a non-technical marketer were published in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-driven-marketing-in-a-web-of-fake-data-e13995e448c8). 

I ghost-wrote a series of blog posts for an IT-sourcing company that were published by Hackernoon:

1. [I have an App Idea…but I’m not a Programmer](https://hackernoon.com/i-have-an-app-idea-but-im-not-a-programmer-77327fe448c3)
2. [Idea to App for under 15k](https://hackernoon.com/idea-to-app-for-under-15k-reality-or-not-399fcd21507e)
3. [PHP is Dead…Viva le PHP!](https://hackernoon.com/php-is-dead-viva-le-php-f5dc5eb5c9c4)
