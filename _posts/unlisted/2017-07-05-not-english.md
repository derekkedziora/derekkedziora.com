I came across a comment when reading the news that immediately struck as coming from the infamous [Russian troll factory][nyt]. Ignoring the content, it serves as a good example of a text that is free of 'mistakes' but still doesn't sound natural.

> Looks dangerous to me. No US President can survive if he allows a regime like Kim's to directly threaten the heartland of the US. There will be war. Just when is difficult to say but soon. Also Japan is a significant military power and looks as if it cannot wait to join in.  

Some issues:

>  Looks dangerous to me.

Dropping the subject is odd; the 'to me' makes it a word for word translation from Russian.

>  the heartland of the US

*the American heartland*  

The [statistics][heart] are overwhelming.

> Just when is difficult to say but soon.

The word order is off. I'd say:

*It's hard to say exactly when, but it's going to happen soon.*

> Also Japan is a significant military power and looks as if it cannot wait to join in.

The word order is awkward, and another [dummy pronoun][dummy] was dropped. 'As if' tends to be formal and doesn't fit in with the of the rest of the comment. This would be more natural:

*Japan is also a significant military power, and it looks like it can't wait to join in too.*

Is the comment English? I suppose it's written in English words, but it's a grammatical text that a native speaker would find awkward to read.
