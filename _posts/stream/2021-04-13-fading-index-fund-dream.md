Make a decent salary, live frugally, invest the rest in index funds and retire early. This was a mantra to live by at one point for me. I’d quote Mr. Money Mustache in regular conversation.

A lot of the advice is still valid. There’s nothing wrong about a simple and reasonably frugal life. Not living paycheck to paycheck gives you options. 

But as a lifestyle, there are [cracks from the early retirement influencer crowd](https://livingafi.com/2021/03/17/the-2021-early-retirement-update/). I can only image what’s *not* being reported. 

When Jack Bogle pioneered index funds, they were a pithy way for a few crackpot investors to beat the system. Yet if index funds become the majority of investors, [they will destroy the system](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/).
