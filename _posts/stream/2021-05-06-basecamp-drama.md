Some thoughts on the recent [Basecamp drama](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/basecamp-politics-ban-resignations.html):  

1. **The mighty are humbled.** DHH and Jason Fried market themselves as the best tech managers out there. Regardless of the backstory, a third of the company leaving, among them many senior employees, shows that something is off at Basecamp. 
2. **Style matters more than substance.** While DHH has many of the “right” opinions, his style is reminiscent of a certain reality TV host: always the center of attention, announcing major company decisions via social media rather than directly to the people involved and generally an online bully. What seems like a maverick and charismatic leader from an outside perspective can be a nightmare at close range. 
3. **The revolution will come for thee.** No amount of wokeness will be enough for some people, and management by trend-driven committees is reckless. Once a joke in poor taste becomes equivalent to genocide, there’s not going to be a productive conversation. 
4. **Non-politicized spaces are important.** I don’t doubt there were people who quietly complained, and many people who added feigned support out of fear. Keeping spaces free of politics gives everyones some much needed breathing room.
5. **A SaaS company or a marketing company?** I wonder how much of Basecamp’s revenue comes from their tech rebel persona and selling books instead of selling their actual software? I can’t say I’m particularly [impressed by their software](/blog/hey-the-app-i-want-to-love).
