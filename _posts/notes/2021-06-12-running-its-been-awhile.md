The last time I ran 5k was in 2016. Then I moved backed to Kyiv, took up biking instead of running, injured my knee, life happened and I fell into a fog. I slowly got out of shape, weight crept on.

Six years later and I’m back. My time was laughably slow, but that’s partially intentional since I’m still doing Maffetone style cardio base work.  

Still it’s a great feeling to be back to running, getting in shape again and moving on from the haze that covered large swathes of the last six years. Small victories.
