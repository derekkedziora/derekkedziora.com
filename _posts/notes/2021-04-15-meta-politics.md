It’s rare to find a solution to all that ails political discourse in a single article, but [Politics is way too meta](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Js34Ez9nrDeJCTYQL/politics-is-way-too-meta) fits the the bill. 

Political journalism and discussion has become all about “policy X will make group Y feel Z” instead of “the result of policy X will be Y”.

This is my new filter to ground any discussion about COVID, politics or almost anything.
