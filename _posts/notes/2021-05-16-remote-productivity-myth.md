That remote work is great and here to stay is one of the dogmas to emerge from the pandemic. I’m all for increased flexibility, but greatness of remote work is an assumption that’s not challenged enough. 

[This study](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/05/13/on-productivity-and-remote-work/) mirrors my own experience:

> Total hours worked increased by roughly 30%, including a rise of 18% in working after normal business hours. Average output did not significantly change. Therefore, productivity fell by about 20%.

The same result is being produced over more hours, with stress, and more burnout. 

If you’re experienced and primarily work independently, remote work may be great for you. But I’ve seen a lot of junior employees struggle and flounder over the past year. I’ve seen a lot of experienced employees think they have no duty to mentor and teach their colleagues grow.
