I’ve previously written about [life around the universe](/blog/other-civilizations)&thinsp;—&thinsp;there are a lot of places and times throughout the universe that could support life. Furthermore, life doesn’t have to be industrial society to be “advanced”. 

Some additional links and thoughts on the matter: 

[Nasa is sending two missions to Venus](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-2-missions-to-study-lost-habitable-world-of-venus). The stated goal is to: 

>  [U]nderstand how Venus became an inferno-like world when it has so many other characteristics similar to ours – and may have been the first habitable world in the solar system, complete with an ocean and Earth-like climate.

And a dose of humility: [95% of the universe is beyond our reach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkD5SeuwzM). This assumes faster than light travel will never be possible. It’s mind boggling to think how much we’ll never know. 

Despite those limitations, there are models for [colonizing the Milky Way](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/294051-scientists-simulate-human-colonization-of-the-milky-way). Each ship would be a multigenerational effort and the process would take millions of years. But it’s theoretically possible. This seems like the [universe Asimov envisioned](http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/spacers_rise_and_fall.html). 

To flip it around, what if the earth was colonized by a group that long ago lost their ties to the mother civilization?
