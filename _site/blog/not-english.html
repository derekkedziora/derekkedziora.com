      <p>I came across a comment when reading the news that immediately struck as coming from the infamous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html">Russian troll factory</a>. Ignoring the content, it serves as a good example of a text that is free of ‘mistakes’ but still doesn’t sound natural.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looks dangerous to me. No US President can survive if he allows a regime like Kim’s to directly threaten the heartland of the US. There will be war. Just when is difficult to say but soon. Also Japan is a significant military power and looks as if it cannot wait to join in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some issues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looks dangerous to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dropping the subject is odd; the ‘to me’ makes it a word for word translation from Russian.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the heartland of the US</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>the American heartland</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=the+heartland+of+the+US%2Cthe+American+heartland%2C&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cthe%20heartland%20of%20the%20U.S.%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Cthe%20American%20heartland%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bthe%20American%20heartland%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bthe%20American%20Heartland%3B%2Cc0">statistics</a> are overwhelming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just when is difficult to say but soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word order is off. I’d say:</p>

<p><em>It’s hard to say exactly when, but it’s going to happen soon.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also Japan is a significant military power and looks as if it cannot wait to join in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word order is awkward, and another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_pronoun">dummy pronoun</a> was dropped. ‘As if’ tends to be formal and doesn’t fit in with the of the rest of the comment. This would be more natural:</p>

<p><em>Japan is also a significant military power, and it looks like it can’t wait to join in too.</em></p>

<p>Is the comment English? I suppose it’s written in English words, but it’s a grammatical text that a native speaker would find awkward to read.</p>
